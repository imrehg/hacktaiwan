There's plenty to do since only 9 days left till we should get on the way. For any hackathon, the most important ingredient is hackers (*duh!*), so currently I'm focusing on getting people interested in this event, if we have a good crowd, everything else will almost take care of itself (I imagine/hope).

## Application form

**Very important**: To apply, please fill out the application form at [http://goo.gl/SrvBc](http://goo.gl/SrvBc), and pass the address on to others who are interested as well. It's not enough to just click "join" on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/382147041825676/).

So far I'm reaching out directly to different groups as well, for example the [Startup Weekend Taipei](http://taipei.startupweekend.org) folks we had an awesome event with two weeks ago, and to the Open Source Developers' Conference [OSDC.TW](http://osdc.tw/) people who seem very well suited for this. Any more ideas who to approach? Just leave me a message, any feedback is appreciated.

## Other things

Things to take care of at the moment:

* Find technical mentors / judges
* Find technical sponsors
* Figure out catering (pizza+coffee, anyone?)
* Set up infrastructure, tools for the day
* Get a timetable for the day
* Let the event info out to the media to build some buzz

At least the venue I don't have to worry about, [AppWorks](http://appworks.tw) kindly let us use their [inclubator space](http://appworks.tw/incubator/), should be nice, [downtown Taipei](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1815435503043542231).
