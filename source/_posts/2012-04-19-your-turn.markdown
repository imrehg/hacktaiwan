## Ideas

For the next two days, **you should start to think about project ideas** that you would like to create at Hack+Taiwan. What interests you? What things could be done better? What new things you could create in a day? (You will be suprirsed how much can be done in a short time:) Dream big, it does worth it!

Also, check out the tools, languages, software that you will plan to use, **refresh your knowledge** and get to know them better. *And can leave a comment here about what's your favorite techology*.

Otherwise, **see you on Saturday**.
